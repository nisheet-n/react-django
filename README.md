# Getting Started with React-Django App

The frontend of this project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The backend of this project was made with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Go to the project's frontend directory and run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## In the root directory, run the django server:

### `python manage.py runserver`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or as mentioned in the terminal to view it in the browser.

The page will not reload if you make edits. You need to re-build it again for deploying any changes.
